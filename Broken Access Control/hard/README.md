### Node Environment Installation
- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer (Latest).
Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

  You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

      $ sudo apt install nodejs
      $ sudo apt install npm

- #### Other Operating Systems
  You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version
    v8.11.3

    $ npm --version
    6.1.0

If you need to update npm, you can do so using the command npm install -g npm. After running the following command, simply open the command line again and you're good to go!

    $ npm install npm -g

###
## Installation and Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project environment and start the server.

### Step 1: Install NPM Libraries

To install the necessary npm libraries, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

or the shorthand version:

```bash
npm i
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and configure the required details. Make sure to include the Postgres database configurations:

```
# Example of .env content
PORT="3555"
ADMIN_USERNAME = "admin"
ADMIN_PASSWORD = "8F7Q=[*5e_b&]Xv[h8Df"
SECRET = "123"
DB_PORT = "5433"
DB_USERNAME = "postgres"
DB_HOST = "localhost"
DB_NAME = "wierd-securitatis"
DB_PASSWORD = "123"
```

### Step 3: Initialize the Database

Run `initDB.js` to initialize the database using the following command:

```bash
node initDB.js
```

Ensure that your Postgres database is up and running before executing the script.

### Step 4: Start the Express.js Server

Finally, start the Express.js server by executing `index.js`:

```bash
node index.js
```

After running this command, your server should be listening on the port specified in your `.env` file.
