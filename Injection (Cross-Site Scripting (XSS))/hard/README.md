# OWASP Top 10 CTF Challenge - Injection (Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)) (Hard)
A stored XSS challenge involving JS injection.
The challenge consists of a customer support website.
Users can send support tickets, which will be read by a bot.
The key is to inject a script that will read and send out the cookies of the bot.
The credentials from the cookies can be used to access the admin page, revealing the flag.
HINT: All data must be cooked.

## Flag Format
Flag will be in the admin page. It can be configured within the .env file.
Format: FLAG{flag_name}
